# Verific

## Motivation 
This project aims to eliminate the need of verifying your kyc on every app. Instead This app works like a protocol on various other apps that ask for kyc.
This solves the problem of waiting for kyc verification which usually takes 2-3 days. 
The users can upload their kyc related documents on this app and when any third party app asks for their kyc the user needs to agree to share it with that app. only then the other app can 
have the access to this kyc. the kyc of user can be withdraw from the other apps through this app. which wouldnt be possible by current means. the other apps can have clients data forever. 

This project brings control back to the user than the services which own the users data.
